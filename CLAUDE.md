# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an AI Underwriting workspace. It currently contains only data files and no source code or build infrastructure.

## Data

All data lives in `DATA/`:
- `RR.xlsx` / `RR Output.xlsx` — Risk Rating input and processed output
- `T12.xlsx` / `T12 Output.xlsx` — T12 (trailing 12-month financial statement) input and processed output
